This workshop will focus on a diverse range of topics relating to current ethical and legal issues in the field of palaeontology. Participants will be able to get involved in one of two ways: (1) by listening in to a series of talks and Q&A session on December 17th (14:00 UTC), or (2) by signing up to join a focus group (max. 30 participants). This workshop is open to all, you do not need to be registered for the Annual Meeting to join the presentation session on December 17th or participate in a focus group.
Each focus group of 5–6 people will be assigned a fictional scenario that concerns an prominent ethical and/or legal issue. During November and early December, groups will meet virtually to discuss the topic and possible future avenues that centre ethics and principles of decolonisation. Each group will be guided by an established researcher who has expertise on the given topic and supported by assigned reading material. Groups will also be able to communicate through a dedicated Discord server for the duration of the event. Each group will then create a short presentation on their findings and recommendations, which will be presented by a designated group member at the virtual session on December 17th. The presentations will be followed by an open Q&A session with the audience.
The recommendations made by the focus groups, alongside key points raised in the Q&A session, will be written up into a report document that will be made publicly available and with the aim of empowering continuing action on matters relating to ethics, legality, and decolonisation in palaeontology.

# Guidelines

Each group will focus on a fictional scenario, based on real-life events, concerning an ethical or legal issue in palaeontology. Your primary task is to explore, discuss, and brainstorm solutions to this scenario, supported by recommended reading and input from an expert researcher. Your outcome should be a set of recommendations for how this scenario should proceed for each individual and stakeholder involved, in order to foster more equitable and ethical research in future.
When thinking about the fictional scenario you have been assigned, here are some questions to guide you, alongside your own experiences:

* Can you identify any issues in the given scenario? What are the major red flags?
* Who are the stakeholders in this situation (students, supervisors, funders, reviewers, editors, professional society, etc.)? Who is most vulnerable/powerful, and why?
* What are the possibilities and limits of individual action? At what level does change need to happen to ensure that this scenario does not repeat itself in the future?
* What recommendations would you make to the stakeholders? How should these recommendations be communicated?
* Are there any other organisations/institutions/people currently not involved who could potentially help with implementing and driving change?

Your final task is to prepare a 10–15 minute presentation. You will need to designate one member of your group to deliver this presentation, which should include the following:
* A brief description of your assigned fictional scenario
* The issues and stakeholders you have identified
* Your recommendations to the individual(s) in your scenario, highlighting what the possibilities and limits of their actions
* Your recommendations to the different stakeholders
* Who else should be involved to implement the policies that you came up with?

  <b>Studies on stolen fossils </h3></b>
  <italic>(Prof Juan Carlos Cisneros, Aura Fossati)</italic>

  <p>
  <b>Scenario:</b>

  <br>You are the editor of a manuscript that was recently submitted and describes a new dinosaur specimen. There are no local authors from the country of origin of the fossil listed on the manuscript. The fossil is currently housed in a museum in the country where the researchers are based. During your usual daily Twitter scroll the day before, you read about previous cases of fossils from the same country of origin as this new dinosaur being illegally taken out of the country and stored in museums abroad, usually in richer countries. Some people have pointed out that the permanent export of this fossil is banned under the law, but you are unable to confirm this. The authors also make no mention of the legality of this new dinosaur specimen in their manuscript as this is not a requirement that your journal has. The new dinosaur specimen being described is scientifically important to dinosaur evolution and you would very much like to see this study published.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Guided questions:</b>

  <ol>
<li>Does this scenario fit in the definition of parachute science or scientific colonialism?</li>
<li>How can you determine that this specimen was legally exported?</li>
<li>Do you need additional information from the authors before sending it out to review?</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Who do you send it out to review?</li>
<li>If it turns out that the specimen was illegally exported, What should be the next steps from the authors or the institution where the material is reposited?</li>
</ol>
<li>Under what circumstance should this study be published?</li>
<li>Should there be any editorial policy changes at the journal level? How can these be implemented and who should be involved to ensure that such situations are prevented? </li>
