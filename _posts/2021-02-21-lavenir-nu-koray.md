Bane koray pe souffer a traver lemond a koz rechaufman klimatik, parey kuma bane koray dan nu lagon morisyen. Bane koray fine egziste pendan lonten. Zone evolye milyon banane de cela ek zot temwen plizier epizod klimatik. Buku fine mor ek zone disparet, me ena osi serten ki fine sirviv sa bane epizod la. Zeolozi donn nu loportinite pu aprann ki bane koray ki fort ek ki bane koray ki vilnerab. Bane paleontolog kolekte bane koray fossil, sa ve dir, bane koray ansyen ki fine preserve kuma roche, a traver lemond. Avec sa bane donne depi bane fossil, mo analiz reaksyon bane koray a sa bane differen epizod klimatik la. Sa pu aide nu compren kuma bane koray pu reazir dan le fitir ek kuma lavenir nu lagon ressemble.

*Corals are suffering worldwide because of climate change, just like those in our Mauritian lagoon. Corals have existed for a long time. They evolved millions of years ago and have witnessed several episodes of climate change. Many died and went extinct while others were resilient enough to survive these episodes.  Geology provides us with the opportunity to learn more about what makes a coral resilient or vulnerable. Fossil corals, that is, the preserved remains of these ancient corals that have turned into rocks, are collected worldwide and studied by palaeontologists. Through the data from these fossils, I analyse the response of corals to different climatic episodes. This will help us understand how corals may respond in the future and what the future of our lagoons looks like.*
